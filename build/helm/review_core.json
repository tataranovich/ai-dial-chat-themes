It can handle a large context window of up to 1 million tokens, enabling it to reason and understand larger volumes of data than other models with lower token limits. Gemini 1.5 Pro can process text, images, audio, and video, and can be used for various tasks such as building conversational AI assistants, analyzing and generating code, and more",

A minor prompting edit can remove this reluctance and result in excellent performance on these tasks [1].

This data included real tasks performed on real documents, with Claude being trained to make fewer mistakes and to avoid expressing unsupported claims [1].",
