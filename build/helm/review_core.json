      "description": "Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus is part of the Claude 3 model family, which is known for setting new industry benchmarks across a wide range of cognitive tasks.\n\nThe Claude 3 family includes three models: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, with Opus being the highest-performing model. It is capable of handling complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks. The default version of Claude 3, Opus, has a context window of 200,000 tokens, but this is being expanded to 1 million for specific use cases",
